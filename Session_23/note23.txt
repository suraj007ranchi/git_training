To make a copy of object in JavaScript, it provide two ways :-
1. Using Object.assign : it has 3 parts :- 
                                    1. target object represented by {} 
                                    2. Source object from which we want to copy
                                    3. Changes on new properties which needs to be added in target.
2. Using Spread Operator (...)

Currying : Currying is an advanced technique of working with functions. Itâ€™s used not only in JavaScript,
           but in other languages as well.
           Currying is a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into 
           callable as f(a)(b)(c).

In JavaScript We can pass function as an argument and we can return a function also as a result.

Partial function : They are nearly same as curry functions with the difference that the Partial function can take
                   any no of args while in case of curry we take only one argument.
        Example :
        const add = x => (y, z) => x + y + z;   <Partial>

        const add = x => y => z => x + y + z;   <curry>

Q1. Create a calculator and implement same by using Partial and Curry function.
