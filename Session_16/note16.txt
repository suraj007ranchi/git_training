JS is programming language.

# Program is made up of input and output.
# It has few rules.
# We need variable to store data. 

In JS we create variable using 
1. Let 		
2. Var
3. Const

OPERATORS are used to transform data.
1. Mathematics operators :-   +,-,*,/,% etc
2. Relational operators :- used for comparison, output will be true or false.
	Ex : > , <, >= , <= , == , != 
3. Assignment operators :   = 

~~ Important ~~
==  : used to compare values only
=== : used to compare value as well as data its type

# In any programming language we have to take decision.

  if(condition){
	// true
 }
 else{
	//false
 }


 if(condition1){
    //true
  }
 else if(condition2){
	// true
     }
 else{
	// false
 }


# Nested If-else
 if(condition1){
     if(condition2){

	}
     else{

	}
 }

# LOOP
 Repeatative Loops are basically used to repeat the steps again and again till a terminating
 condition.

Two types of loop :- 
1. while : while(condition){
		// till condition true, keeps repeating
	   }
	   
2. for   : for loop have 3 parts
	  - initilization / starting value
	  - condition 
	  - increament/decreament

 for(initilization ; condition ; increament / decreament ){
	// body of loop
 }

# Functions  
  They are used to perform repeatative task.
  Function is a name given to group of statements.
  Function helps in code reuseability.
