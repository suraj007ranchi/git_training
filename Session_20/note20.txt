DOM (Document Object Model)

DOM is predefined objects available in browsers only. Within browsers DOM takes up the responsibility to display in it to
the user.
Using DOM objects in javascript we can perform various operation like :-
    1. creating a new element
    2. changing the look and feel on some event
    3. making an element visible/invisible

That is why DOM is very much used in Dynamic HTML.
We can call it DHTML.
In DOM the base element is Document.
Using Document object we can select various elements using predefined methods like FindElementById(), FindElementByName()...

One of the uses of DOM related programming is to capture various HTML events and perform operations on that events.
Some of the common events are: 
    1. onclick()
    2. onchange()
    3. onFocus()....

Some functions like document.getElementByTagName(), document.getElementByClassName(), returns HTML collection. 
To use HTML collection we have to first convert HTML collection to array by using Array.from() method.
